- Took a music listener, artist, songs dataset containing data of around 1048000 rows and size of dataset 1gb
-Imported dataset in google colab yo perform data analysis, data pre-processing, and cleaning.
- Noted the execution time of each cell in google colab.
- implemented the same data operations on pandas of the dataset.
- Noted down the execution time if the same operations are done by pandas
- compared the execution time of both implementation and drawn insights
- Main aim of the project was to implement real time data analysis using Apache Sparke and comparison with normal data analysis
